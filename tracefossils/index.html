			<h3><strong>Trace Fossils</strong></h3>
			<br />
			<p>This section is where we are working on compiling a glossary of ichnotaxa, presented with color images and descriptions. They are listed here by ichnotaxa name. Check back, as we will continue to update the glossary with new ichnotaxa and new images. If you are interested in videos of trace fossils, trace making behavior, or the research performed in our lab, check the videos section of our website.</p>
