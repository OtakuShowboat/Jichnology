        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Tetrapod with pronounced heteropody.  The manus track is pentadactyl, digitigrade and slender, sinuous digits, separated from the proximal base and terminating in claws; digits I and V are opposed and are oriented antero-medially and postero-laterally, respectively with respect to the trackway axis; manus digit II is therefore oriented almost parallel to the trackway axis, with digits III and IV oriented laterally.  The pes impression is tetradactyl, plantigrade, with long slender digits which originate at the same level, ending in claws oriented towards the animal’s direction of progression.  Pes digit divarication, between I and IV high.  Pes digits II and IC subequal in length and slightly shorter than digit III; digit I is shortest.  The heel is oval, almost symmetrical with respect to the central axis of the pes and has a “little heel”.
