        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Plantigrade tracks with the manus having four digits (digit V is highly reduced) and the pes having three digits.  All digits are hooves and the pedal axis passes through digit III for both the pes and manus.  Manus’ digits are smaller and more spread out compared to pes’ digits.  On the pes, Digit III is in front of digits II and IV.  Sole and palm are impressed and the wrist and ankle may be impressed as well.

        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Repichnia
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Continental; terrestrial
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> Perissodactyla mammals, likely the rhinocerotoids.  An immature or small <em>Trigonias</em>, an ancient group of rhinos, is a likely candidate in making the specific trackway described by Sarjeant and Langston, 1994.
