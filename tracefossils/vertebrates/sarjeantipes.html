        <br />
        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Tracks with the manus having four digits (digits II–IV) and the pes having five digits.  The manus is semidigitigrade and about two-thirds the length of the pes which is plantigrade.  All digits end in claw impressions.  Digits II–IV in both the manus and pes have a single, distinct phalangeal pad with the posterior end that is rounded.  The average angle of divarication in both the manus and pes is about 108 degrees.  In the pes, digit V is short (about 80% of the mean length of digit III) and digit I is the shortest (about 65% of the mean length of digit III).  In the manus, digits III and IV are the longest while digit I is the shortest (about 70% to 80% of the length of digits III and IV).  Manus and pes are both slightly wider than they are long.  The trackway is narrow (about one pes width).
