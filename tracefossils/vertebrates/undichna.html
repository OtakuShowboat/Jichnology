        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> The genus includes those trace fossils comprising a set of horizontal waves (incised grooves) with a common wavelength and alignment. The waves may or may not be accompanied by a straight, continuous furrow, upon which they are superimposed. Individual waves may be continuous, or the troughs/crests may be preferentially absent or preferentially present. There may be as many as nine waves in a set; commonly there are only two, and in some cases just one. Waves occur as (1) parallel pairs, (2) non-parallel pairs which are (a) intertwined or (b) separate, and (3) unpaired waves. These waves types occur in a variety of combinations. The traces are impressions (and corresponding moulds) on parting surfaces in flaggy lithologies.
