        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> Lucas et al. (2007) thinks <em>Mammuthicnum</em> should be considered nomen nudum due to the lack of a type ichnospecies and a proper diagnosis of the ichnogenus. This opinion along with the lack of an image for the holotype means that we agree with his hypothesis and we believe that <em>Mammuthichnum</em> should be considered nomen nudum.
