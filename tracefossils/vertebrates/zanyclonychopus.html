        <h3><strong><em>Zanclonychopus</em> Sarjeant and Langston, 1994</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Plantigrade footprints with similar size manus and pes and claws on all digit impressions.  Disregarding digit I, footprints have somewhat of an oval shape to them.  Digit I is off to the side and is lightly impressed compared to digits II–IV which are more deeply impressed.  Digits I–III curve outward while IV and V curve inward.  Pes phalangeal pads are fused whereas those of the manus are free.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Repichnia
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Continental; terrestrial
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> Creodonta animals, possibly a hyaenodont.  It is hypothesized that Hemipsalodon is the tracemaker to the holotype due to the appropriate size though the feet are not know at this time.
