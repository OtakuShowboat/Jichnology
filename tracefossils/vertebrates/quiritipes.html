        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Small to moderate sized semiplantigrade to semidigitigrade ovoid tracks with digits IIâ€“IV.  Manus is somewhat smaller than pes.  The digits acuminate anteriorly and do not have claw impressions.  Digits III and IV are similar in length and are parallel posteriorly and converge towards each other anteriorly.  Digits II and V are shorter (especially pedal digit II) and are directed slightly outward.  The digital pads are separated from the metacarpal and metatarsal pads.  The metatarsal pad is more triangular and deeply impressed anteriorly compared to the metacarpal pad.  The trackway is narrow, the stride is long and the pedal impressions are commonly superimposed on the manual impressions.
