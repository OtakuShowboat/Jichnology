        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Artiodactyl tracks that are elongated and wedge shape.  Manus and pes have two hooves (digit III is the medial hoof and IV is the lateral hoof).  The medial and lateral hooves are mirror images of each other; they are broadest at the posterior end and have an angular, parabolic shape at the anterior end.  Hooves are separated by interdigital space.  The apices of the track can be convergent, parallel or divergent depending on the pace.  Each hoofprintâ€™s maximum breadth is less than 35 percent of its length.
