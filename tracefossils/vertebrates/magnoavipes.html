        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Large (19 to 21 cm in length) aniosodactyl tracks with track width greater than track length.  The angle of divarication between digits II–IV is about 110 degrees.  The angle of divarication between digits II–III compared to III–IV are different creating an asymmetrical appearance.  The digits are slender and have sharp claw impressions at the end of them.  Foot impressions have a slightly outward rotation relative to trackway.
