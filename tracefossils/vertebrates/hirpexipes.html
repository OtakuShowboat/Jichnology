        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Semidigitigrade to semiplantigrade tracks with the manus smaller and shorter than the pes.  Both manus and pes have five digits and all digits are long and exhibit sharp claws.  The manual and pedal digits point forward with the exception of digit IV, which shows a slight, and digit V which show a major, initial outward curve.  The manual digits possess three pads each (though fusion can occur between adjacent pads) and the pedal digits possess four pads except digit I which has only three.  The trackway has a long stride and pace and it is relatively narrow.
