The space between digits III–IV is more anteriorly directed than the space between digits II–III.  Digits III–IV have a more developed  webbing than digits II–III.  The average angle of divarication is between 110 to 120 degrees.  Stride length is short and the tracks have a slight inward rotation.  Track length with hallux is from 7.5–8.0 cm and the width is 6–6.5 cm.
