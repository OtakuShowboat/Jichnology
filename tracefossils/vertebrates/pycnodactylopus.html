        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Moderate sized, semidigitigrade tracks with an ovoid shape.  Four short digits (II–V) on each foot with stout phalangeal impressions that are about two-thirds as wide as they are tall.  Digits II–IV have two digital pads but the distinction between them may not be clear.  Digit V is reduced, particularly in the manus, and the pad is undivided.  The phalangeal impressions are proximally close, if not in contact, to the metacarpal pads and the metatarsal pads.  The trackway is relatively narrow.
