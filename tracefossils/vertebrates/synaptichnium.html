        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Trackway is relatively wider than that of other chirotheriids and exhibits the typical lacertoid habit of pushing the medial border of the pes deeper into the substrate with respect of its lateral border (Peabody, 1948).  The pes is primitive due to the presence of both a long digit IV and an oblique metatarsal-phalangeal axis with lacertoid characteristics (Nopcsa, 1923).  Unique features include orientation of the pes, the relatively large manus, the phalangeal formula, and the divarication of digits.  Many footprints show the impressions of the skin surface and the arrangement of scales.  The size of the scales on the plantar surface and the position of the scales change in different areas of the foot.  The toes are generally characterized by rectangular or ellipsoidal scales with the long axis perpendicular to the digit axis, arranged in irregular rows crossing obliquely and this forming a checkerboard-like pattern.
