        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Track with pentadactyl manus and tetradactyl pes impressions.  Manus length is about 10 percent of pes length.  Manus is wider than long and digits are quite pronounced.  Digit III is the longest followed by digit II, then digit IV, then digits I and V which are both equal in length.  Digit V is more divergent relative to the track’s axis.  Manus angle of divarication between digits I-V can reach almost 180 degrees.  Pes track is longer than wide and the track’s axis is centered on digit III.  Digit III is the longest, digits II and IV are nearly equal in length and digit I is much shorter.  Digits II and IV are symmetrically placed in relation to digit III.  Pes digits end in distinct, blunt, claw impressions.  Pes angle of divarication about 90 degrees.
