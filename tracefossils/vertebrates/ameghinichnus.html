        <h3><strong><em>Ameghinichnus</em> Casamiquela, 1961</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> <em>Eopentapodiscus</em></strong> <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Pentadactyl tracks that are nearly homopod and symmetrical.  Pes impressions slightly larger than manus impressions.  Both imprints are wider than they are long.  The manus imprints are rotated slightly inward and the pes imprints are rotated slightly outward.  Both the lengths and the interangle between digits are nearly equal, all digit impressions are straight and the angle of divarication between digits Iâ€“V is rather large.  Tail marks can be seen often and vary from continuous and sinuous when the tracks alternate to straight and discontinuous when the tracks are opposite from each other.
