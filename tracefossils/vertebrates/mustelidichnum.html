        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Medium-sized plantigrade to digitgrade pentadactyl track with sharp claw impressions.  Claw impressions are not separated from the digital pad.  Digital pads are spheroidal to ovoidal.  Pes is usually larger than the manus and the two are roundish and are slightly wider than long.  The pes is partially webbed; web impressions occur between the central digits.  Digital pads IIâ€“IV are crowded while digital pads I and V are separated slightly creating an asymmetrical appearance.  Interdigital pad is chevron-shaped (though it can be subquadrangular, fused, deeply-lobed and continuous).
