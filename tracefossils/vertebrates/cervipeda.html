        <h3><strong><em>Cervipeda</em> Vialov, 1965</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Tracks with wedge-shaped digital impressions followed by round to rounded-triangular, smaller posterior digit impressions.  Manus and pes can be different in size though similar in appearance.  The track has two main large imprints, digit III and IV, that are mirror image of each other; they are broadest at the posterior end and have an angular, parabolic shape at the anterior end.  Most of the time, the main prints are separated but they can be in contact at the median or the posterior edge.  The apices of the track can be convergent, parallel or divergent depending on the pace.  Each print’s maximum breadth is less than 35 percent of its length.
        <br />
        Can be indistinguishable from <em>Gambapes</em> if dew claw is not impressed.

        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Repichnia
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Continental; terrestrial
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> Artiodactyla mammals, likely Cervidae (deer) mammals.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>GEOLOGIC RANGE:</strong> Upper Eocene–recent
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ADDITIONAL REFERENCES:</strong> Emended by Sarjeant and Langston, 1994
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> The two large imprints are hoof prints. The smaller, posterior tracks are dew claw impressions, and are more likely to appear when the tracemaker is leaping or galloping as opposed to walking.
