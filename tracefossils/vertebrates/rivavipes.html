        <br />
        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Large plantigrade tridactyl bird tracks showing

robust oval heel pad and three elongate digits. Hallux

impression is not present. Phalanges in the shape of

elongate triangles, rather than parallel sided. Digit III is

elongate relative to digits II and IV, which are approximately

equal in length. Heel pad deeper proximally than

distally.
<br />
<br />
	Digit I (hallux) impressions are seldom present. Phalanges

are broad, with most footprints showing merging of

impressions for the heel pad and digits II–IV. Ungual impressions

show the presence of a small triangular claw, but tracks

commonly have indistinct digit terminations, as either an acute

or a rounded apex. Tridactyl shape typically fairly symmetric.

Interdigital angles for digits II–IV are less than 90 degrees.

Track widths measured from apices of digits II and IV are

10–15 cm. Interdigital angles for digits II–III and III–1V are variable,

typically between from 32 to 45 degrees. Interdigital angles

for digits II–IV range from 60 to 85 degrees. Digits II and IV

are approximately equal in length, and approximately 0.8 the

length of digit III. For footprints that preserve distinct ungual

impressions, digits II–IV each terminate in a small equilaterally
triangular toenail.
