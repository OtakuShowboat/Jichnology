        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Two major hoofprints in the large track, the medial hoof is digit III and the lateral hoof is digit IV.  Digit III is usually smaller than digit IV and is shifted distally.  The asymmetry will not be present if tracks were made on a horizontal surface and the tracemaker was walking slowly.  The hoof prints widen proximally and will diverge from each other from 10 to 20 degrees.
