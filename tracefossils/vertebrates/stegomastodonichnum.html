        <br />
        <strong>REMARKS:</strong>  Lucas et al. (2007) thinks <em>Stegomastodonichnum</em> should be merged with <em>Proboscipeda</em> as a junior synonym.  But since they nor known papers have gone forth and merged these two together, <em>Stegomastodonichnum</em> shall remain as its own ichnogenera.
