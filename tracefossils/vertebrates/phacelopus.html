        <h3><strong><em>Phacelopus</em> Sarjeant and Langston, 1994</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Plantigrade to semiplantigrade track with all five digits present along with noticeable claw impressions.  Manus is smaller than pes.  The claws and digits of I and II for both manus and pes curve outward while the claws and digits of III-V curve inward.  There are one to two phalangeal pads per digit in the manus and two to three in the pes.  Metatarsals, some tarsals, metacarpals and some carpals may be distinguishable.  Total interdigital angle of divarication for manus can be up to 70 degrees while the pes can be up to 80 degrees.

        <br />
        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Repichnia
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Continental; terrestrial
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> Likely musteloids due to similar track structure to modern day tracks made my mustelids however; there have been no known mustelid fossils that have been found in the area.  The small canid <em>Hesperocyon</em> might be able to make the track though it is found in a slightly higher strata.
