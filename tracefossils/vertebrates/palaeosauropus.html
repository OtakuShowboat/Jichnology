        <h3><strong><em>Palaeosauropus</em> Hay, 1902</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Footprints of a relatively large quadruped with a pentadactyl pes and tetradactyl manus, in which the pes nearly oversteps the manus and with which tail drags are commonly associate.  In the manus, all digits are relatively broad and have rounded tips, Digit III is longest an digit IV is more widely separated from digit III than are the other digits from each other, The pes has five digits that are also wide and blunt-tipped, digit IV is longest and digit V projects nearly laterally.  Palaeosauropus is distinguised from the similar track of Limnopus by its relatively narrower manus and pes and lack of broad, well-impressed manus and pes sole impressions.
