        <h3><strong><em>Dischidodactylus</em> Sarjeant and Wilson, 1988</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Plantigrade tracks with manus smaller than pes and five digits located on both of them.  The hallux and pollex is shortened and is not align with the other digits, digit V of manus is also reduced.  Digit IV of pes is distally divided and has two claws while digits III and IV of manus are sometimes distally divided and may have two sets of claws.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Repichnia
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Continental; terrestrial
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> The unusual morphology of the track makes it difficult to pinpoint a probable tracemaker.  Sarjeant and Wilson (1988) hypothesized it was created from either a large insectivore, like <em>Simidectes</em>, or a creodont, like <em>Hyaenodon</em>.
