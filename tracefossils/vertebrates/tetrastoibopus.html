        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> Early mammals belonging in Carnivora.  They were likely created by the dog like carnivore <em>Miacis</em> (Miacoidea), since they are the appropriate size and they are found in the same region and formation as the footprints.  The feet of <em>Miacis</em>, however, remains undescribed.
