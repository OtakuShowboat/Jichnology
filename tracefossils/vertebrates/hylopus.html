        <br />
        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Pentadactyl manus and pes, though digit I is reduced and barely visible. Digits on the manus display unequal free lengths, with digit IV being the longest. They also display slight counter-clockwise curvature, with the exception of digit II, which is straight. Divarication angles between the digits are large, primarily between digits III and IV. Sole length is short. The digits on the pes are straight except for digit IV, which shows slight counter-clockwise curvature. All pes digits have similar free lengths as well as similar divarication angles (except for digits IV-V), and are all forward facing except for digit V which angles outwards.
