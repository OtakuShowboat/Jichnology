        <br />
        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Trackway consisting of relatively small footprint impressions with a body and tail drag throughout its length.  Each impression shows a circular to oval outline and probably corresponds to the superposition of a manus and pes print.  Thus, the more circular impressions might be interpreted asa total superposition and the elongate ones to a partial superposition.  In the midline of the trackway there is a broad, “sine-wave-shaped dragmark” as wide as the intermanus distance.  Along the trackway, the body drag partially razes the footprints thus suggesting, together with its wideness, that it might correspond to both the belly and the tail drag.  Trackway shows regrular progression of the tracemaker with short steps, and small footprints relatively close to the midline of the trackway.  The moderately low pace angulation (approximately 106°), and the shape of the body/tail drag indicate an elongated animal with a sprawling gait and having part of its body in continuous contact with the substrate during progression.
