        <strong>JUNIOR SYNONYM(S):</strong> N/A <br />
        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Quadruped trackway of negative footprints showing impressions of digits, metacarpus, and metatarsus of both manus and pes.  Manus track has three preserved digits with parallel orientation, Digit II is the smallest and there is an increase in length from Digit II-IV, manus prints are 33 cm apart.  Pes is larger than the manus and has four preserved digits and the probability of a fifth, Digit I-IV increase in length and Digit V is smaller in size, digits have parallel orientation.  Fingers project to form a crest while metacarpus and metatarsal part is weakly depressed to form an arch-shaped posterior border.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Repichnia (locomotion), possible running trace as digits are more impressed than the metacarpus and metatarsus regions
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Continental; terrestrial
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> Young considered <em>Kuangyuanpus</em> to be a running trace.  The trace was assigned to <em>Batrachopus</em> by Zahn et al 1989, but Lockley et al. 2010 believes <em>Kuangyaunpus</em> to be similar to the crocodilian swimming trace <em>Hatcherichnus</em>.
