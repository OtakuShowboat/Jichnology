        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> Description from Uchman (1998). Trace exhibited as irregular hypichnial nets instead of branching meanders now included in <em>Megagrapton</em> instead of <em>Protopaleodictyon</em>, after Kern, 1980. Trace may exhibit transitional forms from <em>Cosmorhaphe</em> or <em>Belorhaphe</em> to <em>Protopaleodictyon</em>.
