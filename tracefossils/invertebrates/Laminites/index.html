        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Straight to meandering burrows that are sub-circular in cross section and are usually parallel to the bedding plane. These burrows can be up to 7.5 cm in width and 50 cm in length and are filled with parallel laminations that are convex in distal direction.

        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Pasichnia, laminations are interpreted as separate packets of feces extruded into the burrow and packed around the rounded posterior of the animal (Ghent and Henderson, 1966).
