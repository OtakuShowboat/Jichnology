<h3><strong><em>Polykladichnus</em> Fursich, 1891</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Infaunal burrow with a vertical shaft that branches upward near the bedding surface into a y-shaped burrow, usually connecting to bedding surface. Burrows vary from 3-5 mm in diameter and are at least 15 cm in length, and can have branching at several levels, as well as second order branching. Tubes are circular in cross-section and have unornamented walls and do not have widened junctions at points of bifurcation.
