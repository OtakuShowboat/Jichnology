        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> Pickerill (1982) introduced <em>Glockerichnus</em> as a replacement name for <em>Glockeria</em> because Pickerill was informed that the genus name was already in use as a phacopid trilobite genus designated by Wedekind (1912); however, <em>Glockeria</em> Wedekind was determined invalid and placed under Phacopidella Reed (1905) by McLearn (1918). Since the trilobite genus <em>Glockeria</em> Wedekind was synonymized with <em>Phacopidella</em>, the use of <em>Glockeria</em> Ksiazkiewicz as an ichnogenus is valid and has priority over <em>Glockerichnus</em>.
<em>Glockeria</em> is also a plant genus designated by Nees (1847), later placed under <em>Hansteinia</em> Oersted (1854).  Under the ICZN (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature) and ICN (International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants), names of animal and plant genera do not compete in priority, but designating and using animal and plant taxa with identical names is highly discouraged.
