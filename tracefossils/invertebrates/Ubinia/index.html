<h3><strong><em>Ubinia</em> Grossheim 1961</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Trace fossils preserved as a hypichnial, straight or slightly winding, axial string with arcuate or straight simple branches.  <em>Ubinia</em> has a zigzag-shaped axial part and the branches alternate on either side along the length of the central axis (after Wetzel & Uchman, 1997).

        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Fully marine flysch deposits
        <br />

        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> Marine worms?
        <br />

        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> <em>Ubinia</em> Grossheim was revised by Wetzel & Uchman, 1997. Graphoglyptids, "gardening" and "trapping" burrows (<em>sensu</em> Seilacher, 1977), such as <em>Paleodictyon</em> and <em>Ubinia</em> are representative of low to intermediate benthic food levels. The occurrence of patterned feeding burrows and deep- layer colonizers indicates that benthic food was available below the layer inhabited by graphoglyptid producers.
