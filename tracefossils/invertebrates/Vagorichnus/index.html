<h3><strong><em>Vagorichnus</em> Buatois and Mangano, 2009</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Vagorichnus consists of complex burrow systems composed of discontinuous curved to meandering segments in which irregular networks are formed. Traces are preserved as hypichnial ridges on the sole of turbidite sandstones.

        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> A new ichnogenus, <em>Vagorichnus</em>, is figured and described from Jurassic lacustrine turbidites of the Anyao Formation, Henan Province, Central China. The ichnospecies <em>V. anyao</em> covers burrow systems characterized by constricted and irregularly annulated segments, and ridge-like knobs. Although several lines of evidence indicate that these ichnofossils record the activity of a post-event infauna. <em>Vagorichnus</em> occurs as discrete and compound ichnotaxa. In the latter case, it grades into <em>Gordia</em> and <em>Tuberculichnus</em>.
