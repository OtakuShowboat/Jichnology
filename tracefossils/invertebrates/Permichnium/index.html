<h3><strong><em>Permichnium</em> Guthorl, 1934</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Two parallel rows of v-shaped foot impressions that are equal in size, equidistant, and may be orientated obliquely from track axis or perpendicular to track axis so v-shaped imprints open to exterior. The trackway has a smooth, unornamented median furrow.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Repichnia, interpreted as a running track of an organism with equal walking feet with two claws on each foot.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Continental environments located close to water such as marginal lacustrine zones and ephemeral ponds in alluvial environments. Preserved most often in low energy environments of a transitional subaqueous/subaerial environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> Arthropods such as blattoids  
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>GEOLOGIC RANGE:</strong> Permian-Triassic
        <br />

        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> Description from Hantschel (1975) and Avanzini (2011). <em>Permichnium</em> is similar to <em>Bifurculapes</em> Hitchcock, 1858. Using trace position with respect to interpreted locomotion direction, Kozur (1989) separated some species from the ichnogenus <em>Permichnium</em> into a new ichnogenus <em>Hoburgichnium</em>.
