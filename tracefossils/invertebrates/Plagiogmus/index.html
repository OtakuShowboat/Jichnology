<h3><strong><em>Plagiogmus</em> Roedel, 1929</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Mucus- lined burrow that forms a ribbon-like trail preserved in concave epirelief, parallel to bedding. Outer roof structure is furrowed and contains a sinuous median. Inner burrow exhibits transverse ridges across the floor and may have laminations of backfill formed 20 degrees from parallel that form a diagnostic “ladder trail.” <em>Plagiogmus</em> infill is generally finer grained than surrounding media.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Trace is formed by domichnia and fodinichnia of deposit feeders. Furrow is caused by organism extension of siphon to the sediment surface. Transverse bars may be the result of organism's use of posterior sucker during locomotion.
        <br />
