<h3><strong><em>Halimedides</em> Lorenz von Liburnau, 1902</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Simple, straight to slightly curved, horizontal to oblique, unlined, tubular burrow with a symmetrically distributed series of heart-shaped, angular, trapezoid, oval, semispherical, or bilobate chambers along its length.  Filled with light, structureless or pelleted mudstone; pellets are elongate. Scratch marks are visible on the walls of tunnels and chambers in well-preserved specimens. (After Uchman, 1998; Gaillard and Olivero, 2009; Kotlarczyk and Uchman, 2012).<br />
        <br />
        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Chambers used for food capture and storage. Used for microbial farming by trace-maker; lobes of chambers contain farmed organic material; organized to improve ventilation through burrow system.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Deep marine environments of stiffground to firmground media. Densely chambered specimens are indicative of lower oxygenation; sparse chambering indicates higher oxygenation. (Gaillard and Olivero, 2009).
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> Crustaceans.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>GEOLOGIC RANGE:</strong> Cambrian-recent
        <br />
