<h3><strong><em>Trichophycus</em> Miller and Dyer 1878</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Subhorizontal burrow or burrow system composed of one or more broad, originally open, U-shaped burrows, characteristically having a nodose gallery, and in exceptionally well preserved cases, with biradial striation on the walls of nodes. These features distinguish <em>Trichophycus</em> from <em>Treptichnus</em>.

        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> <em>Palaeophycus</em>‚Äù <em>virgatus</em> Hall, 1847, is considered an older synonym. The <em>Trichophycus pedum</em> Ichnozone, an assemblage-zone, is taken to indicate the presence of the first well-developed, metazoan animals, and thereby indicative of the boundary between Precambrian and Phanerozoic strata. The position of the GSSP coincides with the FAD of <em>Trichophycus pedum</em> and the base of the T. pedum Ichnozone as known at the time of ratification (Landing, 1994). This may be in doubt as <em>Treptichnus pedum</em> may be the actual trace that is used.
The <em>T. pedum</em> Ichnozone is an assemblage-zone based on trace fossils. It reflects the appearance of complex sediment-disturbing behavior by multiple metazoans (Ed Landing, et al, Global standard names for the Lowermost Cambrian Series and Stage, Episodes, Vol. 30, no. 4.).
