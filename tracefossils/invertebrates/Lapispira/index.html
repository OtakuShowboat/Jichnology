<h3><strong><em>Lapispira</em> Lange, 1932</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Subvertical, concentrically arranged double helicoidal, corkscrew-like burrow. The two spirals are of constant diameter and connect at the base by an S-shaped burrow curve. The internal corkscrew diameter is 2-4 cm and the external corkscrew diameter is 4-7 cm. The burrow is tubular, unlined and unbranched, and may have scratch marks. There is no spreiten between the internal and external corkscrews. The burrows are generally filled with finer material than the host sediments.
