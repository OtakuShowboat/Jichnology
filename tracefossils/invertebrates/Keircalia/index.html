<h3><strong><em>Keircalia</em> Smith, 1909</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Trackway with two parallel rows of closely spaced imprints with four central grooves, the outermost of which may be discontinuous. The width of the trackway is 12-13 mm, and the trackway may have a high degree of sinuosity. The individual imprints are sharp and often lunate in shape and lie transversely to the midline of the track and occasionally run into each other, forming a “patter” with no recognizable sets. The four grooves in the center of the trackway form two pairs, the inner pair is continuous but the outer pair is not.
