        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Round-ended cylindrical bodies of about 1.5 mm in length and about 0.5 mm in diameter. The bodies are composed of material different from that of the matrix and are homogeneous throughout. They usually occurred loosely strung out in clusters. The pellets can be up to 10 cm long and 1-2 cm broad, on bedding planes.
