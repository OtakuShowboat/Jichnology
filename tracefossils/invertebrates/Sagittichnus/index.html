<h3><strong><em>Sagittichnus</em> Seilacher 1953</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Discrete traces that look like arrowheads, with a median keel, up to 5 mm long. They occur in groups and are oriented in similar directions. Horizontal to the bedding plane, preserved in concave hyporelief, and slightly bilobate to elongate arrow-shaped traces 3 to 5 mm long, and 1 to 3 mm wide.
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Marine, freshwater floodplain settings, ephemeral lakes
        <br />
        <br />
