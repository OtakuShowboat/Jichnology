        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Bedding-parallel burrow that may be straight to curved or gently meandering. Parataenidium are meniscate backfilled, tubular burrows similar to Taenidium, except backfill is separated at two distinct horizontal levels. The backfill levels are separated by a discontinuity and differentiated by composition and/or fabrication; the upper level is composed of globular or barrel-shaped sediment beads while the lower level is structureless. Burrows are oblate in cross section.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Repichnia and fodinichnia; the two levels are interpreted to represent distinct behaviors, with the feeding burrow located above the locomotion burrow. The upper feeding burrow is interpreted to represent sediment of fecal origin, while the lower burrow is of locomotory origin.
