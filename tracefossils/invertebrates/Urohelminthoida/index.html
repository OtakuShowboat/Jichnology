<h3><strong><em>Urohelminthoida</em> Sacco 1888</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Trace fossil preserved usually as string-sized, deep hypichnial meanders. Lateral appendages protrude outwardly from the curved segments of the meanders. The lateral appendages which pass straight into one arm of the meanders, but form an angle with the second arm are the most pronounced feature of this ichnotaxon, approximately 60 mm long. The distance between meanders varies from tight to widely spaced (cf. Uchman, 1995).
