<h3><strong><em>Polarichnus</em> Narbonne, 1979</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Large vertical u-shaped burrows up to 50 cm long, 15 cm broad and 10 cm deep and lacking spreiten. Sedimentary laminae between the arms of the burrow are domed upwards and exhibited as asymmetric folds and thrusts. Trace is observed on bedding surface as elongate with parallel sides and rounded ends. U-shaped burrow may be seen on bedding surface too, exhibited as sub-rectangular, becoming more elliptical with depth. The burrow is unlined and unlaminated. Between the arms is an imbricate structure of laminae that looks like transverse furrows and is preserved in convex epirelief.
