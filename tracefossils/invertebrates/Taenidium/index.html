<h3><strong><em>Taenidium</em> (Heer, 1877)</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Unlined or thinly-lined, cylindrical to subcylindrical straight to sinuous tubes with meniscate backfill and radiate downwards; commonly, oblique to bedding and tend not to cross-sect others, unless made by different organism.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Feeding burrows of deposit-feeders.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Shallow to deep marine settings, continental terrestrial, fluvial.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> Annelid worms.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>GEOLOGIC RANGE:</strong> Cambrian-recent.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> Ichnogenus should be restricted to the morphologies of the type material (counter to Keighley and Pickerill, 1994).  In eolian environments, <em>Taenidium</em> is thinly lined, meniscate burrows subparallel to the slipface and curve slightly upwards, downwards, and sideways in the sediment.  Menisci are less regular in shape and spacing than in <em>Entradichunus</em> and no evidence of roof collapse in the burrow.
