<h3><strong><em>Paleodictyon</em> (Meneghini, 1850)</strong></h3>

        <br />

        <br />
        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Dwelling burrow system used for cultivating/trapping bacteria and other microbes, agrichnia.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Shallow to deep marine.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> Burrowing marine animals such as worms.
        <br />

        <strong>GEOLOGIC RANGE:</strong> Precambrian/Early Cambrian – ?Eocene

        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> Though found most commonly in deep-sea settings, <em>Paleodictyon</em> evolved in shallow marine environments during the Late Precambrian and Early Cambrian and later migrated to deep marine environments by the Late Cambrian. <em>Paleodictyon</em> has been reported in Mesozoic and Cenozoic shallow marine deposits, and rarely in post-Cambrian Paleozoic shallow marine deposits.
