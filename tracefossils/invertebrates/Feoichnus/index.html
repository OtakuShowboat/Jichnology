        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Occur in a wide variety of continental environments, most often found in well-drained soils.  
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> Dung beetles

        <br />
        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> 3D image of <em>Feoichnus</em> can be seen <a href="/videos/animations/3dfeoichnus.html">here</a>.  Often found in <em>Coprinaesphera</em> samples.  Interpreted by Krause et al., 2008 as feeding traces by cicadas, however, research by Hasiotis (2002) and other dung beetle references show this trace to have been created by dung beetle larvae feeding on dung sausages.
