        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> Frey and Howard (1985) suggested that <em>Monocraterion</em> should be viewed as an ichnospecies of  <em>Skolithos</em>; however, multiple authors (e.g., Alpert, 1974; Fillion and Pickerill, 1990; Jensen, 1997) consider the funnel-shaped morphology as distinct and characteristic of a separate ichnogenus. Eroded specimens of <em>Monocraterion</em> maybe diagnosed as specimens of <em>Skolithos</em>, while from upper bedding plane views, specimens may be diagnosed as <em>Rosselia</em> and/or <em>Laevicyclus</em> (Fillion and Pickerill, 1990; Jensen, 1997).
