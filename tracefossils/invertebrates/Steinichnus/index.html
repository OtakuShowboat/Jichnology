<h3><strong><em>Steinichnus</em> Bromley and Asgaard, 1979</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Cylindrical shaped horizontal to sub-horizontal unlined burrows with
structureless burrow fill.  Burrow walls contain series of narrow transverse ropey ridges or scratch marks. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Locomotion and most likely, deposit feeding behavior of either mud-loving beetles or mole crickets.  The trace is constructed by the adult burrowing and pushing its way through relatively firm, moist medium just below the sediment surface.  Scratches on the burrow wall are created by the organism excavating and moving sediment out of its path (Hasiotis, 2002).
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Continental. Commonly constructed in wet habitats associated with alluvial and marginal lacustrine environments.  Mainly found in sediment along river banks, back-swamps and splays, and pond or lake shorelines.  The burrows signify areas of high water tables or standing water that is relatively fresh.  Most common in perennial bodies of water or temporary bodies of water associated with wet seasonal to wet climates with high humidity (Hasiotis, 2002).
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> Beetles or mole crickets.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>GEOLOGIC RANGE:</strong> Triassic-recent.

        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> Ekdale et al. (1984) reassigned to <em>Spongeliomorpha carlsbergi</em>, however, Metz (1993) suggested that the ichnogenus Steinichnus be retained for the non-marine forms.
