        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Curved or meandering horizontal surface trails consisting of a smooth median furrow flanked on either side by pairs of spindle-shaped ridges whose long axes make an acute angle with axis of trail. Outside of each pair of ridges are oval depressions of similar size that commonly overlap. Trace is approximately bilaterally symmetrical.
