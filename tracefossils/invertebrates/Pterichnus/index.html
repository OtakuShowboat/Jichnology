<h3><strong><em>Pterichnus</em> Hitchcock, 1865</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Straight to sinuous trackway that consists of two symmetrical horizontal rows of repeated, elongate scratch-like impressions that are turned outward at an angle of 15-20 degrees from axis of trackway. Impressions are similar in size and shape and lack drag marks. External width of trackway is between 4 and 12 mm. Trackways have alternate symmetry and resemble a feather; direction of motion is towards inverted scratches.

        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> Description from Gaillard (2005). There are four morphotypes of <em>Pterichnus</em> that include Type 1: trackway with well-defined parallel rows with no scratch pattern; Type 2: holotype described above; Type 3: trackway with scratches lying almost parallel to trackway axis, which are often connected to each other; Type 4: shallow trackway with flat bottom. These morphotypes vary depending on preservation and media consistency; Type 1 was formed under the driest sediment, while Type 4 under the wettest (Gaillard, 2005).
