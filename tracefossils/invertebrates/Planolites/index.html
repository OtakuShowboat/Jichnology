<h3><strong><em>Planolites</em> Nicholson, 1873</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Simple, unlined, unbranched cylindrical or subcylindrical infilled burrows, straight to gently curved, horizontal to oblique to bedding planes. Burrows may cross-over. Lithology of fill differs from that of host rock.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>BEHAVIOR(S):</strong> Deposit feeding, dwelling.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS:</strong> Shallow marine - deep marine deposits to continental.  Found in alluvial, lacustrine, and eolian settings.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>POSSIBLE TRACEMAKERS:</strong> Various invertebrate burrowing organisms including worms and insects.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>GEOLOGIC RANGE:</strong> Precambrian-recent.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong>REMARKS:</strong> Often difficult to distinguish between <em>Palaeophycus</em>, a passively filled burrow, from <em>Planolites</em>, a burrow formed by active backfill that may be of similar size, shape and orientation (Pemberton and Frey, 1982; Buckman, 1995; Keighley and Pickerill, 1995).
