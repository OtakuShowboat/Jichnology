<h3><strong><em>Spongeliomorpha</em> Saporta, 1887</strong></h3>

        <br />
        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> Vertically elongated, circular or oval chambers located above multiple branching points of the burrow network. More than one horizontal maze is developed as discrete tiers, connected to larger vertical shafts. Surfaces show angled, crisscross ornament of sublongitudinal ridges and grooves that cover all surfaces, commonly  developed more strongly on floors than on roofs.  Dominantly horizontal mazes of strongly ornamented cylindrical burrow-fills reaching 10 mm in diameter. Multiple branching-points occur.  Features include the strong wall ornament, numerous chambers in the deeper tier, the discrepancy in size of shafts and galleries, and many openings to the seafloor.
