<h3><strong>Introduction to Ichnology</strong></h3><br />
        Here you can find information that will introduce you to
        ichnology as a scientific discipline. This section details
        the most up to date information on the subjects of
        paleoichnology and neoichnology, but those interested in
        more information should also check our reprints page
        containing papers written by Dr. Hasiotis and our
        comprehensive bibliography. This section of the website is
        broken down into an overview of the the concepts of the
        field, a summary of ichnologic models (ichnofacies models)
        that explains the difference between continental and marine
        ichnology, and a comprehensive glossary defining all the
        terms used by ichnologists.
