        Soil biota community’s response to C3-C4 transition in the
        Brady soil, Central Great Plains
        <br />

        <strong>Research</strong>
        <br />
        My research will focus on how soil biota in the Brady soil
        responded to climate change during the Pleistocene-Holocene
        boundary. The Brady soil records a change from a cooler
        climate to a much warmer and dryer climate. I will
        determine if this had an effect on the biota by using
        burrow size as a proxy for body size. My research will
        examine the distribution of taxa, any individual response
        to the C3-C4 transition, and an ichnotaxonomic analysis of
        the trace fossils. My areas of interest include
        paleoecology, paleoenvironments and paleontology.
