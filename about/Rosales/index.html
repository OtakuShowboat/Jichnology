        Sequence Stratigraphy of the Fayetteville Shale:
        Significance for Shale Gas Reservoirs

        <strong>Research</strong>
        <br />
        My general area of interest is sedimentology and
        stratigraphy, particularly in relation to petroleum. My
        research focuses on the sequence stratigraphy and
        depositional environments of the Fayetteville Shale in the
        Arkoma basin. This Late Mississippian formation is a
        producing natural gas source in Arkansas. I hope to
        construct a genetic framework for use as a predictive tool
        for petroleum exploration. My project will incorporate
        outcrop, core, well log, and thin section study to
        determine and interpret the sedimentology, trace fossils,
        depositional environments, and sequence stratigraphy of the
        Fayetteville Shale.
