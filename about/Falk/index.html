        <strong>Research</strong>
        <br />
        I am interested in the tracks and traces of birds, both fossil and modern, as well as the general gross morphology and functional morphology of both fossil and ancient birds. I am also interested the evolution of avian migration, avian osteology, and the origin and evolution of birds. I also have minor interests in paleoecology and vertebrate anatomy (mainly in the functional morphology of animals other than birds). My current research focuses on analyzing the behaviors of Early Cretaceous bird tracks from the Haman Formation of South Korea, re-describing and interpreting bird tracks from several areas in China, as well as performing a series of morphologic measurements on the feet of fossil and modern birds to try and reconstruct soft tissue structures on the feet of Early Cretaceous fossil birds. I am also studying the behaviors and parameters under which modern bird tracks are produced.
